# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,
<br /><br />
As a highly skilled web developer with over 10 years of experience, I have written a wide range of web applications, from consumer productivity software to mission-critical financial trading platforms. My extensive knowledge of front-end JavaScript and browser APIs, along with my significant experience with popular frameworks and libraries like React and Redux, enables me to create highly performant and scalable applications.
<br /><br />
My expertise also includes a deep understanding of various web development technologies such as Javascript, Typescript, Angular, and Vue, as well as traditional technologies like PHP, Node/Express, MongoDB, and MySQL. I am committed to delivering high-quality work with clean and efficient code, ensuring that my clients receive the best possible product within the shortest possible timeframe.
<br /><br />
I take pride in my ability to deliver excellent results while maintaining open communication with my clients to ensure their needs are met. If you're looking for a skilled and experienced web developer who is dedicated to delivering exceptional work, please don't hesitate to contact me.
